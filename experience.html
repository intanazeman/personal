		February 4th, 2018. I did a runway in helping a friend of a friend out for her project. She took fashion designer, so for their university project they need to have someone to wear their cloth and do a runway. For that year it was a Korean theme, so we needed to wear hanbok. A korean traditional cloth. I have no experience at all, but i did it anyway because it was a great opportunity for me to at least get to experience it once. Won 2nd place out of 3rd. I was shocked and happy at the same time.
