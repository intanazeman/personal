	<h2>
		First family photo of 2021.
	</h2>
		<img src="fam.jpg" width="550px" height="440px"/>
		<p>
			The one and only photos that have all my family members.I don't even remembered when was the last time we all take photos together and all family members are in it. Plus we have one new family member which is my eldest brother's wife. They just got married early last year. This photo was taken when we had dinner together before my second brother and dad fly away to their own places for work.

	<h2>
		Let's get into the details
	</h2>

	<h3>
		MY super DAD
	</h3>
		<p>
			My dad name is Azeman bin Yusoff. He works in the Navy for almost 55 years now. He was rarely at home ever since I was little but when he is, we always spend time together. I still remember how he used to make us a kite from a bamboo stick and a paper. However, sadly, most of the kite did not fly high but my brother and I had fun running around so that the kite would fly high up in the sky. 
		</p>

	<h3>
		MY lovely MOM
	</h3>
		<p>
			My mom name is Siti Raihan binti Mohamed. She is a teacher and she teaches highschool students. My mom is one of the woman that can do things on her own. I'd say that she is a very strong and independent woman because she can raised 3 children on her own, most of the time. Back then, my dad always have to go out to sail. I remembered that she always had to pick me up at school because I always had a fever and gastric. She would rushed to picked me up and brought me to the clinic and then she goes back to work. 
		</p>

	<h3>
		MY 2 annoying BROTHERS
	</h3>
		<p>
			The eldest one is Ahmad Taufeq and the second one is Arif Hussaini. Both of them are doing well in life, working at a big company. Back in primary school, my brothers always took care of me because we are only one year apart from each other. So, we always goes to school together. We started to grew apart when they both entered boarding school after UPSR.
